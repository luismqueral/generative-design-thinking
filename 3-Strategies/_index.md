## Overview

While patterns describe the "what" and "why" of generative design thinking approaches, strategies focus on the "how" - providing practical, actionable prompts and techniques that can be immediately applied.

Each strategy will include:

- A descriptive name
- The design challenge it addresses
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Prompt templates and examples
- Considerations and variations
- Expected outcomes

Strategies will be organized by design phase (research, ideation, prototyping, testing, etc.) and by the type of design challenge they best address.
