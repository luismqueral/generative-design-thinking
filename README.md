# Generative Design Thinking

This repository contains the evolving manuscript for "Generative Design Thinking," a book exploring the relationship between design, design thinking, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Structure

The book is organized into three main parts:

### 1. Theory
Explores the art and spirit of Generative Design Thinking, providing the philosophical foundation and conceptual framework.

### 2. Patterns
Documents new kinds of workflows that emerge at the intersection of design thinking and generative AI.

### 3. Strategies
Offers specific prompts and techniques that readers can reference and adapt to grow their generative design work.

## Inspiration

This work is inspired by Christopher Alexander's seminal works "The Timeless Way of Building" and "A Pattern Language," adapting their approach to the new frontier of generative AI in design.

## Development

This manuscript is being developed in the open, with all changes tracked through git. The content is primarily written in Markdown using Obsidian.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project, observations, suggestions, and discussions are welcome through GitHub issues.
