# Generative Design Thinking

This is a repository for ongoing set of notes on "Generative Design Thinking" which is the process of design work using assistive AI tools. My thoughts are a mess right now, so don't expect anything too interesting yet. This will grow over time and this repo will track those changes.

I'm approaching these notes in a similar way to two pioneering generative thinkers: Christopher Alexander (_A Pattern Language_ and _Timeless Way of Building_) and Brian Eno.

## Structure

There are three pieces to these notes:

### 1. Theory
The art and spirit of Generative Design Thinking -- a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework.

### 2. Patterns
Documents new kinds of workflows that emerge at the intersection of design thinking and generative AI.

### 3. Strategies
Offers specific prompts and techniques that readers can reference and adapt to grow their generative design work. This is linked to another project of mine Strategy Garden: http://strategy.garden
