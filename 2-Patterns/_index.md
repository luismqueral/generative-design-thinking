*No patterns documented yet*

## Overview

Similar to Christopher Alexander's pattern language, this section will catalog repeatable design patterns that emerge when working with generative AI tools. Each pattern will include:

- A clear name and description
- Context in which the pattern applies
- Problem the pattern addresses
- Solution approach using generative AI
- Examples of the pattern in practice
- Related patterns and connections

Patterns will be organized from larger systemic approaches to more specific tactical implementations.
